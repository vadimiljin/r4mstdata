GPS is a specific satellite-based navigation system operated by the US, consisting of 24 satellites. Satelite is a broader term that includes various satellite networks used for positioning, communication and data transmission, such as Globalstar, Iridium and Inmarsat","propertyID":"feature_32"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Real-time Dashcam capture","value":"Real-time dashcam capture is increasingly becoming a valuable feature within telematics systems, enhancing fleet management and safety. By integrating video with traditional telematics data like GPS location, speed and driving behavior, it provides a comprehensive view of vehicle and driver activity, enabling proactive safety measures and efficient incident response. ","propertyID":"feature_8","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"}],"featureList":["Publicly Accessible API Documentation","Satellite","Driver's behavior monitoring","Real-time Dashcam capture","Fuel usage reporting","GPS Tracking"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/bfs/#bfsOrganization","name":"BFS","url":"http://www.bfs.tv/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-BFS-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/bfs.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"In addition to renting, BFS offers its customers many other services such as maintenance and repair, purchase and sale of vehicles, financing, transfer service for vehicles, training and further education as well as driving and spare training at the FSO's own academy, training courses, telematics solution BFS Telematics.","areaServed":[{"@type":"Country","name":"Croatia (Hrvatska)"},{"@type":"Country","name":"Germany"},{"@type":"Country","name":"Switzerland"}]},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
