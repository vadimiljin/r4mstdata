These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Document Management","value":"Drivers can use smartphone or tablet to capture delivery photos, record notes, collect electronic signatures and more. Access to these records allows for quick investigation of claims related to overages, shortages, damages, or missed delivery windows. Documents and notes are available anytime, enabling faster processes for tasks like customer invoicing, payroll and operational reviews.","propertyID":"feature_38","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Emergency call (SOS button)","value":"An SOS button in a vehicle, often linked to telematics and eCall systems, allows drivers to manually trigger an emergency call to emergency services. This feature can also be activated automatically in the event of a serious accident where airbags or seatbelt pre-tensioners are deployed. The system sends the vehicle's location and other relevant information to the emergency call center.","propertyID":"feature_5","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECall"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Security services","value":"Security services in telematics provide protection through multiple layers including theft prevention with real-time tracking and tamper alerts, unauthorized use detection via geofencing and after-hours monitoring, rapid stolen vehicle recovery, driver protection through dashcam evidence for false claim exoneration, cybersecurity measures with data encryption and authentication, system redundancy for critical safety functions, continuous monitoring and diagnostics.","propertyID":"feature_44","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management#Fleet_security_and_control"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"}],"featureList":["Customizable Reports","Customer Geofencing","Document Management","Emergency call (SOS button)","Driver's behavior monitoring","Security services","Fuel usage reporting","GPS Tracking"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/acron/#acronOrganization","name":"Acron","url":"https://www.acronshop.ro/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-Acron-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/acron.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"Acron was founded in 2010 with a mission to develop state-of-the-art fleet monitoring and management technology.
