These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Accident/Crash notification","value":"Telematics systems with accident/crash notification features use vehicle data and communication technology to automatically alert emergency services and other relevant parties when a collision is detected. These systems often combine GPS, accelerometers and other sensors to identify accidents, including rollovers and sudden impacts. Upon detection, the system can automatically notify emergency responders, fleet managers, or other designated contacts, providing crucial information like vehicle location and potentially even real-time video footage. ","propertyID":"feature_23"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Real-time Dashcam capture","value":"Real-time dashcam capture is increasingly becoming a valuable feature within telematics systems, enhancing fleet management and safety. By integrating video with traditional telematics data like GPS location, speed and driving behavior, it provides a comprehensive view of vehicle and driver activity, enabling proactive safety measures and efficient incident response. ","propertyID":"feature_8","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Trip KPI dashboard","value":"A Trip KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard, integrated with telematics, provides a comprehensive overview of vehicle trip data, enabling fleet managers to track and analyze key performance indicators for efficient fleet management. This dashboard offers insights into various aspects of each trip, such as fuel consumption, distance traveled, driving time, idling time and more, allowing for data-driven decision-making. ","propertyID":"feature_10","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Android (Driver)","value":"Android (Driver) telematics features enable a smartphone to act as a telematics device, capturing and transmitting driving data to a fleet management or other platform. These features often include automatic trip detection, driving behavior analysis (speeding, braking, etc.) and real-time communication with fleet managers. Some apps even offer features like dash cam functionality, enabling video recording and storage and integration with navigation and music apps. ","propertyID":"feature_16","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"iOS (Driver)","value":"iOS driver telematics features basically turn a smartphone into a telematics device, tracking and sending driving data to a fleet management system. They usually include things like automatic trip detection, behavior tracking (like speeding or hard braking) and real-time communication with fleet managers. Some apps even double as dash cams, letting you record video, store footage and link up with navigation or music apps.","propertyID":"feature_17","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Tachograph, odometer reading","value":"Tachographs, primarily used to record driving time and distance for compliance with regulations, can be integrated with telematics systems to provide additional data and functionality, including odometer readings.
