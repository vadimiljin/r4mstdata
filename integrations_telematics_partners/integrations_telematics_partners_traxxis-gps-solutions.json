By integrating video with traditional telematics data like GPS location, speed and driving behavior, it provides a comprehensive view of vehicle and driver activity, enabling proactive safety measures and efficient incident response. ","propertyID":"feature_8","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Diagnostic Error Code Alerts","value":"Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) are alerts generated by a vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) system to indicate malfunctions. Telematics, which combines telecommunications and informatics, can read and interpret these DTCs in real-time, providing immediate alerts to fleet managers and maintenance personnel. This integration allows for proactive maintenance, reduced downtime and optimized fleet management.

ELDs, which are intrinsically linked to HOS regulations, automatically record a driver's driving time and duty status, ensuring adherence to legal limits on driving hours and rest periods. Telematics enhances this process by providing real-time data and insights for fleet managers to monitor compliance, improve safety and optimize operations.
