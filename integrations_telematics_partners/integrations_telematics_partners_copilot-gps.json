By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Traffic","value":"Telematics systems use traffic data to optimize routes, enhance safety and improve operational efficiency in transportation and logistics.

These features often include automatic trip detection, driving behavior analysis (speeding, braking, etc.) and real-time communication with fleet managers. Some apps even offer features like dash cam functionality, enabling video recording and storage and integration with navigation and music apps.

They usually include things like automatic trip detection, behavior tracking (like speeding or hard braking) and real-time communication with fleet managers. Some apps even double as dash cams, letting you record video, store footage and link up with navigation or music apps.","propertyID":"feature_17","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}],"featureList":["Driver's behavior monitoring","GPS Tracking","Traffic","Android (Driver)","iOS (Driver)"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/copilot-gps/#copilot-gpsOrganization","name":"CoPilot GPS","url":"http://www.copilotgps.com/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-CoPilotGPS-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/co-pilot-gps.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"Offline GPS / satellite navigation app for iPhone / iPad, Windows Phone 8 & Android Smartphones and Tablet.","areaServed":[{"@type":"Country","name":"United States"}]},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
