This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Security services","value":"Security services in telematics provide protection through multiple layers including theft prevention with real-time tracking and tamper alerts, unauthorized use detection via geofencing and after-hours monitoring, rapid stolen vehicle recovery, driver protection through dashcam evidence for false claim exoneration, cybersecurity measures with data encryption and authentication, system redundancy for critical safety functions, continuous monitoring and diagnostics.","propertyID":"feature_44","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management#Fleet_security_and_control"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy.
