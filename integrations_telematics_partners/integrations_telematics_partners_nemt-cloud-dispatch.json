These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Workflow Triggers & Rules","value":"In telematics, workflow triggers and rules automate actions based on specific events or conditions detected by vehicle tracking and other sensors. These triggers and rules streamline fleet management by automating tasks, improving safety and enhancing efficiency. They allow for proactive responses to potential issues and optimize operations based on real-time data. ","propertyID":"feature_35","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD","value":"OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) in telematics is a standardized vehicle diagnostic system that allows telematics devices to plug into any vehicle's OBD-II port (standard since 1996) to extract real-time engine and vehicle data like speed, fuel consumption, and diagnostic codes. This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Hardwired Non-OBD Harness","value":"A hardwired non-OBD telematics harness allows for more advanced features and deeper integration with a vehicle's electrical system compared to standard OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) port connections. These harnesses often include power, ignition and ground wires, enabling features like engine immobilisation, driver behavior monitoring and detailed diagnostics. ","propertyID":"feature_22","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_harness"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Security services","value":"Security services in telematics provide protection through multiple layers including theft prevention with real-time tracking and tamper alerts, unauthorized use detection via geofencing and after-hours monitoring, rapid stolen vehicle recovery, driver protection through dashcam evidence for false claim exoneration, cybersecurity measures with data encryption and authentication, system redundancy for critical safety functions, continuous monitoring and diagnostics.","propertyID":"feature_44","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management#Fleet_security_and_control"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver/vehicle scheduling","value":"Driver and vehicle scheduling features in transportation and logistics software optimize route assignments, manage driver availability and ensure efficient fleet utilization. These features streamline operations by automating tasks like route planning, vehicle assignment and shift scheduling, ultimately leading to cost savings and improved service delivery. ","propertyID":"feature_30","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_management"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD GPS Tracking","value":"OBD GPS tracking uses a device plugged into a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port to gather and transmit vehicle data, including location, speed and engine diagnostics, via GPS and cellular networks.
