These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service.

GPS is a specific satellite-based navigation system operated by the US, consisting of 24 satellites. Satelite is a broader term that includes various satellite networks used for positioning, communication and data transmission, such as Globalstar, Iridium and Inmarsat","propertyID":"feature_32"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"}],"featureList":["Customizable Reports","Customer Geofencing","Satellite","Fuel usage reporting","GPS Tracking"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/fleetjack/#fleetjackOrganization","name":"FleetJack","url":"http://www.fleetjack.com/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-FleetJack-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/fleet-jack.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"Real time location tracking of vehicles from anywhere at anytime.
