These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD","value":"OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) in telematics is a standardized vehicle diagnostic system that allows telematics devices to plug into any vehicle's OBD-II port (standard since 1996) to extract real-time engine and vehicle data like speed, fuel consumption, and diagnostic codes. This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Hardwired Non-OBD Harness","value":"A hardwired non-OBD telematics harness allows for more advanced features and deeper integration with a vehicle's electrical system compared to standard OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) port connections. These harnesses often include power, ignition and ground wires, enabling features like engine immobilisation, driver behavior monitoring and detailed diagnostics. ","propertyID":"feature_22","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_harness"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Accident/Crash notification","value":"Telematics systems with accident/crash notification features use vehicle data and communication technology to automatically alert emergency services and other relevant parties when a collision is detected. These systems often combine GPS, accelerometers and other sensors to identify accidents, including rollovers and sudden impacts. Upon detection, the system can automatically notify emergency responders, fleet managers, or other designated contacts, providing crucial information like vehicle location and potentially even real-time video footage. ","propertyID":"feature_23"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD GPS Tracking","value":"OBD GPS tracking uses a device plugged into a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port to gather and transmit vehicle data, including location, speed and engine diagnostics, via GPS and cellular networks.

ELDs, which are intrinsically linked to HOS regulations, automatically record a driver's driving time and duty status, ensuring adherence to legal limits on driving hours and rest periods. Telematics enhances this process by providing real-time data and insights for fleet managers to monitor compliance, improve safety and optimize operations.
