These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Workflow Triggers & Rules","value":"In telematics, workflow triggers and rules automate actions based on specific events or conditions detected by vehicle tracking and other sensors. These triggers and rules streamline fleet management by automating tasks, improving safety and enhancing efficiency. They allow for proactive responses to potential issues and optimize operations based on real-time data. ","propertyID":"feature_35","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Satellite","value":"Although often used interchangeably, Satellite and GPS tracking refer to different concepts. GPS is a specific satellite-based navigation system operated by the US, consisting of 24 satellites. Satelite is a broader term that includes various satellite networks used for positioning, communication and data transmission, such as Globalstar, Iridium and Inmarsat","propertyID":"feature_32"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD","value":"OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) in telematics is a standardized vehicle diagnostic system that allows telematics devices to plug into any vehicle's OBD-II port (standard since 1996) to extract real-time engine and vehicle data like speed, fuel consumption, and diagnostic codes. This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Emergency call (SOS button)","value":"An SOS button in a vehicle, often linked to telematics and eCall systems, allows drivers to manually trigger an emergency call to emergency services. This feature can also be activated automatically in the event of a serious accident where airbags or seatbelt pre-tensioners are deployed. The system sends the vehicle's location and other relevant information to the emergency call center.","propertyID":"feature_5","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECall"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy.
