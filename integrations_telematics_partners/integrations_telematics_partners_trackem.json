","propertyID":"feature_22","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_harness"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Accident/Crash notification","value":"Telematics systems with accident/crash notification features use vehicle data and communication technology to automatically alert emergency services and other relevant parties when a collision is detected. These systems often combine GPS, accelerometers and other sensors to identify accidents, including rollovers and sudden impacts. Upon detection, the system can automatically notify emergency responders, fleet managers, or other designated contacts, providing crucial information like vehicle location and potentially even real-time video footage. ","propertyID":"feature_23"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD GPS Tracking","value":"OBD GPS tracking uses a device plugged into a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port to gather and transmit vehicle data, including location, speed and engine diagnostics, via GPS and cellular networks.
