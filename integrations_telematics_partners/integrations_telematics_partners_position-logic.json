These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Workflow Triggers & Rules","value":"In telematics, workflow triggers and rules automate actions based on specific events or conditions detected by vehicle tracking and other sensors. These triggers and rules streamline fleet management by automating tasks, improving safety and enhancing efficiency. They allow for proactive responses to potential issues and optimize operations based on real-time data. ","propertyID":"feature_35","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD","value":"OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) in telematics is a standardized vehicle diagnostic system that allows telematics devices to plug into any vehicle's OBD-II port (standard since 1996) to extract real-time engine and vehicle data like speed, fuel consumption, and diagnostic codes. This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Trip KPI dashboard","value":"A Trip KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard, integrated with telematics, provides a comprehensive overview of vehicle trip data, enabling fleet managers to track and analyze key performance indicators for efficient fleet management. This dashboard offers insights into various aspects of each trip, such as fuel consumption, distance traveled, driving time, idling time and more, allowing for data-driven decision-making. ","propertyID":"feature_10","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver/vehicle scheduling","value":"Driver and vehicle scheduling features in transportation and logistics software optimize route assignments, manage driver availability and ensure efficient fleet utilization.
