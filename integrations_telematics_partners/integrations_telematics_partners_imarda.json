These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Publicly Accessible API Documentation","value":"Benefits of using a telematics API: improve safety and productivity, while reducing life-cycle costs; optimise business operations and improve efficiency; track and monitor all your assets from one location; modern maintenance (with telematics API data provided) helps to reduce equipment failures; eliminate guesswork - accurate data enables you to make reliable decisions and calculate life-cycle costs.","propertyID":"feature_2","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Real-time Dashcam capture","value":"Real-time dashcam capture is increasingly becoming a valuable feature within telematics systems, enhancing fleet management and safety. By integrating video with traditional telematics data like GPS location, speed and driving behavior, it provides a comprehensive view of vehicle and driver activity, enabling proactive safety measures and efficient incident response. ","propertyID":"feature_8","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Trip KPI dashboard","value":"A Trip KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard, integrated with telematics, provides a comprehensive overview of vehicle trip data, enabling fleet managers to track and analyze key performance indicators for efficient fleet management. This dashboard offers insights into various aspects of each trip, such as fuel consumption, distance traveled, driving time, idling time and more, allowing for data-driven decision-making. ","propertyID":"feature_10","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Tachograph, odometer reading","value":"Tachographs, primarily used to record driving time and distance for compliance with regulations, can be integrated with telematics systems to provide additional data and functionality, including odometer readings. This integration allows for remote access to tachograph data, including odometer readings, alongside other telematics data like vehicle location, driver behavior and engine diagnostics. ","propertyID":"feature_11","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachograph"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"RFID Driver ID","value":"RFID driver identification in telematics allows for tracking which driver is operating a vehicle by using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. This feature is especially useful when multiple drivers share the same vehicle, as it enables accurate tracking of vehicle usage and driver behavior. ","propertyID":"feature_27","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Maintenance Schedules","value":"Telematics enhances fleet maintenance by providing data-driven insights for scheduling and optimizing maintenance activities. By tracking vehicle data like mileage, engine hours and fuel consumption, telematics allows for more precise and proactive maintenance, leading to reduced downtime, improved efficiency and lower costs. ","propertyID":"feature_28","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_maintenance_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Vehicle Engine Diagnostics Codes","value":"Telematics systems can integrate with Vehicle Engine Diagnostic Codes, also known as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). These systems monitor various vehicle components and systems and when a fault is detected, they can relay the corresponding DTCs to a central platform. This allows for remote diagnostics, proactive maintenance and potentially reduced downtime. ","propertyID":"feature_19","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Diagnostic Error Code Alerts","value":"Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) are alerts generated by a vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) system to indicate malfunctions. Telematics, which combines telecommunications and informatics, can read and interpret these DTCs in real-time, providing immediate alerts to fleet managers and maintenance personnel. This integration allows for proactive maintenance, reduced downtime and optimized fleet management.
