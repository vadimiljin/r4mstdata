These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD","value":"OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) in telematics is a standardized vehicle diagnostic system that allows telematics devices to plug into any vehicle's OBD-II port (standard since 1996) to extract real-time engine and vehicle data like speed, fuel consumption, and diagnostic codes. This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Security services","value":"Security services in telematics provide protection through multiple layers including theft prevention with real-time tracking and tamper alerts, unauthorized use detection via geofencing and after-hours monitoring, rapid stolen vehicle recovery, driver protection through dashcam evidence for false claim exoneration, cybersecurity measures with data encryption and authentication, system redundancy for critical safety functions, continuous monitoring and diagnostics.","propertyID":"feature_44","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management#Fleet_security_and_control"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Traffic","value":"Telematics systems use traffic data to optimize routes, enhance safety and improve operational efficiency in transportation and logistics. By integrating real-time and predictive data, telematics can help reroute vehicles around congestion and hazardous conditions, potentially reducing travel time, fuel costs and accident rates. ","propertyID":"feature_14","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Manual Turn-by-Turn Voice Guidance","value":"Manual turn-by-turn voice guidance is a feature where a user receives spoken instructions to navigate a route, often using a smartphone or vehicle's telematics unit. This guidance is manually initiated, meaning the user starts the navigation and the system provides step-by-step directions, including alerts for upcoming turns and deviations from the route. ","propertyID":"feature_49","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-by-turn_navigation"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Automated Turn-by-Turn Voice Guidance","value":"Automated turn-by-turn voice guidance is a telematics feature that provides drivers with spoken directions to navigate to a destination. This feature is can be triggered by voice commands or selections on a touchscreen. Telematics systems use GPS, cellular communication or satellite to determine location and provide guidance, often with options for visual aids like maps or route information. ","propertyID":"feature_43","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-by-turn_navigation"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"RFID Driver ID","value":"RFID driver identification in telematics allows for tracking which driver is operating a vehicle by using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. This feature is especially useful when multiple drivers share the same vehicle, as it enables accurate tracking of vehicle usage and driver behavior. ","propertyID":"feature_27","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Tachograph, odometer reading","value":"Tachographs, primarily used to record driving time and distance for compliance with regulations, can be integrated with telematics systems to provide additional data and functionality, including odometer readings. This integration allows for remote access to tachograph data, including odometer readings, alongside other telematics data like vehicle location, driver behavior and engine diagnostics.
