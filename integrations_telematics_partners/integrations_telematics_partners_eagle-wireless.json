This data is then combined with GPS tracking and transmitted via cellular networks to provide fleet managers with comprehensive vehicle health monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and predictive maintenance capabilities.","propertyID":"feature_4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Real-time Dashcam capture","value":"Real-time dashcam capture is increasingly becoming a valuable feature within telematics systems, enhancing fleet management and safety. By integrating video with traditional telematics data like GPS location, speed and driving behavior, it provides a comprehensive view of vehicle and driver activity, enabling proactive safety measures and efficient incident response. ","propertyID":"feature_8","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver/vehicle scheduling","value":"Driver and vehicle scheduling features in transportation and logistics software optimize route assignments, manage driver availability and ensure efficient fleet utilization. These features streamline operations by automating tasks like route planning, vehicle assignment and shift scheduling, ultimately leading to cost savings and improved service delivery. ","propertyID":"feature_30","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_management"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"OBD GPS Tracking","value":"OBD GPS tracking uses a device plugged into a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port to gather and transmit vehicle data, including location, speed and engine diagnostics, via GPS and cellular networks.
