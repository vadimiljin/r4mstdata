These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Satellite","value":"Although often used interchangeably, Satellite and GPS tracking refer to different concepts. GPS is a specific satellite-based navigation system operated by the US, consisting of 24 satellites. Satelite is a broader term that includes various satellite networks used for positioning, communication and data transmission, such as Globalstar, Iridium and Inmarsat","propertyID":"feature_32"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"POI's","value":"In telematics, Points of Interest (POIs) are specific locations that are relevant to fleet operations, like customer locations, delivery points, or service centers. They are essentially named locations with geographic coordinates that can be used to enhance various telematics features. These features include real-time trip updates, trip management, better ETA analysis and more detailed reporting.","propertyID":"feature_33","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Android (Management)","value":"Telematics management on Android involves using mobile applications to monitor, analyze and manage vehicle data collected by telematics devices.
