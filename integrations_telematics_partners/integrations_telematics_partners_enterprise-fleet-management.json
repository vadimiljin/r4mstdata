These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Accident/Crash notification","value":"Telematics systems with accident/crash notification features use vehicle data and communication technology to automatically alert emergency services and other relevant parties when a collision is detected. These systems often combine GPS, accelerometers and other sensors to identify accidents, including rollovers and sudden impacts. Upon detection, the system can automatically notify emergency responders, fleet managers, or other designated contacts, providing crucial information like vehicle location and potentially even real-time video footage. ","propertyID":"feature_23"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Trip KPI dashboard","value":"A Trip KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard, integrated with telematics, provides a comprehensive overview of vehicle trip data, enabling fleet managers to track and analyze key performance indicators for efficient fleet management. This dashboard offers insights into various aspects of each trip, such as fuel consumption, distance traveled, driving time, idling time and more, allowing for data-driven decision-making. ","propertyID":"feature_10","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver/vehicle scheduling","value":"Driver and vehicle scheduling features in transportation and logistics software optimize route assignments, manage driver availability and ensure efficient fleet utilization.
