When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service.

By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"}],"featureList":["Publicly Accessible API Documentation","Customer Geofencing","Satellite","Driver's behavior monitoring","GPS Tracking"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/isr-transit/#isr-transitOrganization","name":"ISR Transit","url":"https://isrtransit.com/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-ISRTransit-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/isr-transit.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"ISR systems are found with numerous governments, utility, service, security and other commercial enterprises.
