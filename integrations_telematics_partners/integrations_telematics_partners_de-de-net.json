These reports can be created based on various criteria like vehicle, trip, or driver and can include detailed information on fuel usage, driving behavior and more. This flexibility enables businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends and make data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and safety. ","propertyID":"feature_1","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Customer Geofencing","value":"Geofencing, when integrated with telematics, allows businesses to create virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS technology. When a vehicle equipped with telematics crosses these boundaries (enters or exits), automated actions or alerts are triggered. This technology enhances fleet management by providing real-time location updates, improving route compliance, optimizing delivery times and boosting customer service. ","propertyID":"feature_3","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Accident/Crash notification","value":"Telematics systems with accident/crash notification features use vehicle data and communication technology to automatically alert emergency services and other relevant parties when a collision is detected. These systems often combine GPS, accelerometers and other sensors to identify accidents, including rollovers and sudden impacts. Upon detection, the system can automatically notify emergency responders, fleet managers, or other designated contacts, providing crucial information like vehicle location and potentially even real-time video footage. ","propertyID":"feature_23"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Driver's behavior monitoring","value":"A driver behavior monitoring system is a technology-driven solution that continuously tracks and analyzes how drivers operate their vehicles. By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"}],"featureList":["Customizable Reports","Customer Geofencing","Accident/Crash notification","Driver's behavior monitoring"],"softwareHelp":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://support.route4me.com/category/telematics-vendors/"}},{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://route4me.com/integrations/telematics/partners/de-de-net/#de-de-netOrganization","name":"De De Net","url":"http://www.dedenet.de/en/products/dedefleet/?utm_source=Route4Me&utm_medium=Telematics4Me&utm_campaign=Route4Me-DeDeNet-Integration","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/resources/addons/website-public/img/vendor-logos/de-de-net.webp","width":256,"height":196},"description":"DeDeFleet gets you to your destination faster: simply integrate this telematics and vehicle location solution into your standard transportation management solution via interface to make it equally available for your car and lorry fleet operations.
