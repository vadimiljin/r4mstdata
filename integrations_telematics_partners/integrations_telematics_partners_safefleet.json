By using vehicle telematics, GPS and various in-vehicle sensors, the system collects data on driving actions - speed, acceleration, braking and cornering - to provide real-time insights into driver performance.","propertyID":"feature_6","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_monitoring_system"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Android (Management)","value":"Telematics management on Android involves using mobile applications to monitor, analyze and manage vehicle data collected by telematics devices.
