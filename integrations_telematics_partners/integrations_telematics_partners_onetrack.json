This feature can also be activated automatically in the event of a serious accident where airbags or seatbelt pre-tensioners are deployed. The system sends the vehicle's location and other relevant information to the emergency call center.","propertyID":"feature_5","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECall"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Stolen vehicle recovery","value":"Telematics plays a crucial role in stolen vehicle recovery by providing real-time location tracking and remote control capabilities. When a vehicle is stolen, telematics systems can pinpoint its exact location, enabling swift recovery by law enforcement. These systems also offer features like remote engine shutdown and geofencing, further aiding in the recovery process and acting as a deterrent to theft.","propertyID":"feature_41","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Fuel usage reporting","value":"Telematics systems offer advanced fuel usage reporting features that provide detailed insights into fuel consumption, enabling fleet managers to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce costs. These features include comprehensive fuel consumption reports, real-time alerts for potential issues like fuel theft or wastage and tools for monitoring driving behavior that impacts fuel economy. ","propertyID":"feature_9","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"GPS Tracking","value":"Telematics incorporates GPS tracking as a core component, enabling the monitoring of vehicle location and movement. Telematics systems use GPS data, along with other information from the vehicle's on-board diagnostics, to provide a comprehensive view of vehicle performance and driver behavior. This data is transmitted to a central system where it can be analyzed and used for fleet management, improving efficiency and enhancing safety.","propertyID":"feature_24","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Traffic","value":"Telematics systems use traffic data to optimize routes, enhance safety and improve operational efficiency in transportation and logistics. By integrating real-time and predictive data, telematics can help reroute vehicles around congestion and hazardous conditions, potentially reducing travel time, fuel costs and accident rates. ","propertyID":"feature_14","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"POI's","value":"In telematics, Points of Interest (POIs) are specific locations that are relevant to fleet operations, like customer locations, delivery points, or service centers. They are essentially named locations with geographic coordinates that can be used to enhance various telematics features. These features include real-time trip updates, trip management, better ETA analysis and more detailed reporting.","propertyID":"feature_33","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Android (Management)","value":"Telematics management on Android involves using mobile applications to monitor, analyze and manage vehicle data collected by telematics devices.
