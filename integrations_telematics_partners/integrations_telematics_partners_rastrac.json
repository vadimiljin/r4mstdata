                    "value": "Telematics features play a crucial role in achieving Hours of Service (HOS) and Electronic Logging Device (ELD) compliance for commercial vehicles. ELDs, which are intrinsically linked to HOS regulations, automatically record a driver's driving time and duty status, ensuring adherence to legal limits on driving hours and rest periods. Telematics enhances this process by providing real-time data and insights for fleet managers to monitor compliance, improve safety and optimize operations. ",
