It three-dimensionally evaluates and optimizes the loading process into your container so that items are packed in the safest and most efficient way possible, especially when handling odd-shaped items. Items are loaded in reverse-route order so that items for your first stop are in the back of your vehicle, ensuring proper balance and distribution during transport.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/real-time-load-planning-optimization/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/real-time-load-planning-optimization/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/real-time-load-planning-optimization","alternateName":["3D
