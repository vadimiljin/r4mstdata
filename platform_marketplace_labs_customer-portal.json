As the number of customers you serve daily increases, so does the administrative and customer service burden on your organization. Our customer portal solves this by allowing your customers to sign in using a tracking number or their Account ID to monitor the status of their inbound visit. You control exactly how much information is revealed, including estimated arrival times, driver identity, custom fields, and other delivery details.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal","alternateName":["Self-Service Delivery Tracking","Delivery Status Portal"],"sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_tracking"],"subjectOf":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#webpage"}},{"@type":"Action","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#action","name":"Request Customer Portal Information","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://route4me.com/contact"},"description":"Contact our team to discuss implementing the Customer Portal for your organization","object":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#thing"}},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#accessmethod","name":"Customer Access Methods","value":"Account ID login, tracking number lookup"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#visibilityoptions","name":"Visibility Options","value":"Estimated arrival times, driver identity, custom fields, visit status"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#businessbenefits","name":"Business Benefits","value":"Reduced customer service calls, minimized administrative tasks"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#customization","name":"Customization Features","value":"Controllable information disclosure"},{"@type":"ItemList","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#features","name":"Customer Portal Key Capabilities","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Reduce inbound customer service calls by providing self-service status tracking"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Allow customers to monitor delivery status without contacting your team"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Control exactly what information each customer can view about their delivery"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Share driver identity and credentials when appropriate"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"name":"Include custom fields in customer view"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":6,"name":"Reduce time spent on routine customer service activities"}],"itemListOrder":"Unordered"},{"@type":"CreativeWork","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#help","name":"Customer Portal Documentation","url":"https://support.route4me.com/","author":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"about":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#thing"}},{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/customer-portal/#primaryimage","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-core/img/marketplace/customer-portal.png","caption":"Route4Me Customer Portal for delivery status tracking and monitoring","alternateName":"Self-service delivery tracking portal for Route4Me customers","width":800,"height":384},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
