Let's say you run an IT company, and one of your technicians is an Apple expert, while another is more experienced with Windows. In this scenario, it doesn't make any sense to treat both of these employees the same when you assign clients to them. You know it makes the most sense to send the Apple expert to your clients who use Apple computers and the employee with Windows proficiency to your clients who use Windows computers. Route4Me makes it easy to adapt your operations to situations like this. With the Driver Skills and Vehicle Attributes constraint, you can specify what each of your customers needs and what each of your field employees can do and which vehicle is best suited to the visit. Then, when you plan your routes, field employees and specific vehicles will be automatically assigned to the right stop. Your employees will enjoy their jobs more, your customers will get better service, and you will improve your business's reputation. Everyone wins.","offers":{"@type":"Offer","availability":"https://schema.org/InStock","description":"Monthly subscription pricing per user with access to all Driver Skills and Vehicle Attributes features.","seller":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"priceSpecification":{"@type":"PriceSpecification","price":"10","priceCurrency":"USD"},"offeredBy":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"potentialAction":{"@type":"Action","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://route4me.com/contact/","actionPlatform":"https://schema.org/DesktopWebPlatform"},"name":"Request Driver Skills Implementation"}},"additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Workforce Management Features","value":"Employee skill matching, vehicle matching"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Vehicle Capabilities","value":"Vehicle suitability for specific stops"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Implementation Requirements","value":"Route4Me subscription"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Business Process Integration","value":"Route planning workflow"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Industry Applications","value":"IT services"}],"featureList":["Match employees to customers based on skills","Match vehicles to specific customer needs","Specify customer requirements","Specify employee capabilities","Specify vehicle suitability","Automatically assign right employee to right stop","Automatically assign right vehicle to right stop","Improve employee job satisfaction","Improve customer service quality","Enhance business reputation"],"about":[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Field Service Management","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_service_management"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Workforce Optimization","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_management"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Resource Allocation","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Information Technology Service Management","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Computer Technician","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_technician"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Fleet Management","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management"}],"softwareRequirements":"requires web browser or mobile app for configuration","isRelatedTo":{"@type":"SoftwareApplication","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/route-optimization-software/#softwareapplication","name":"Route4Me Route Optimization Software","operatingSystem":"Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS","applicationCategory":"BusinessApplication","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.6","ratingCount":"25736","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","description":"The weighted aggregate rating was calculated using ratings from multiple platforms (weighted by review count and platform credibility): Google Play (4.3, 14544 reviews, weight 0.7), Apple App Store (4.6, 10700 reviews, weight 1.5), Capterra (4.4, 390 reviews, weight 4.0) and G2 (4.6, 102 reviews, weight 5.0).
