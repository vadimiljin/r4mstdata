With voice-guided GPS navigation, drivers can keep their eyes on the road while receiving accurate directions and ETAs. Unlike consumer GPS apps, Route4Trucks creates routes specifically for commercial vehicles, helping drivers avoid low-clearance accidents and unauthorized roads. Perfect for both local deliveries and long trips spanning multiple states, it works for LTL, FTL drivers, and even RV enthusiasts.","offers":{"@type":"Offer","availability":"https://schema.org/InStock","description":"Try Route4Trucks with a 7-day free trial, then $9.99/month for continued access to commercial truck routing and GPS navigation.","seller":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"priceSpecification":{"@type":"PriceSpecification","price":"9.99","priceCurrency":"USD"},"offeredBy":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"potentialAction":{"@type":"Action","target":[{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/route4trucks-truck-gps-app/id1634215573","actionPlatform":"https://schema.org/IOSPlatform"},{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.route4me.route4trucks&pli=1","actionPlatform":"https://schema.org/AndroidPlatform"}],"name":"Download Route4Trucks App"}},"additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Vehicle Compatibility","value":"All Class 1-8 commercial vehicles, trucks, and RVs"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Route Planning Features","value":"Multi-stop route planning, vehicle parameter constraints, state and local regulation compliance"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Navigation Features","value":"Voice-guided GPS directions, real-time navigation, accurate ETAs, traffic avoidance"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Implementation Requirements","value":"iOS or Android mobile device, subscription after free trial period"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Route Constraints","value":"Height, width, weight, hazmat restrictions, and commercial vehicle regulations"}],"featureList":["Designed specifically for commercial vehicles","Easily plan multi-stop commercial routes","Routes adapt to height, width, weight, hazmat and more","Drive more safely with in app voice-guided navigation","Stay compliant with commercial trucking regulations","Real-time navigation with accurate ETAs","Traffic avoidance for efficient route planning","Compatible with all Class 1-8 Vehicles","Support for both local deliveries and long-distance trips","Available for both iOS and Android platforms"],"about":[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Commercial Vehicles","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Trucking Industry","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trucking_industry_in_the_United_States"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Route Planning","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_planning_software"}],"softwareRequirements":"Compatible with iOS and Android mobile devices","isRelatedTo":{"@type":"SoftwareApplication","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/route-optimization-software/#softwareapplication","name":"Route4Me Route Optimization Software","operatingSystem":"Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS","applicationCategory":"BusinessApplication","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.6","ratingCount":"25736","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","description":"The weighted aggregate rating was calculated using ratings from multiple platforms (weighted by review count and platform credibility): Google Play (4.3, 14544 reviews, weight 0.7), Apple App Store (4.6, 10700 reviews, weight 1.5), Capterra (4.4, 390 reviews, weight 4.0) and G2 (4.6, 102 reviews, weight 5.0).
