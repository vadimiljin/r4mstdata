The bundled destination aggregates all sub-destination details like weight, cube, pieces, cost, revenue, and service time. Each original stop remains accessible as a sub-item, allowing team members to individually capture signatures, photos, scan labels at each destination. ETAs, automatic alerts, and other platform capabilities continue to work seamlessly. You can customize bundling rules to maintain high route optimization quality, with flexible options for handling service times based on your specific business needs.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/stops-bundling/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/stops-bundling/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/stops-bundling","alternateName":["Intelligent
