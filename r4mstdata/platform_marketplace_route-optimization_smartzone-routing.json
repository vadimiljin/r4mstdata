Once you've got your zones, use Route4Me to create optimized routes with the addresses in each zone. You'll save massive amounts of time you'd normally waste and be confident that every route you create with Route4Me is as good as it can get. This solution helps you determine the best number of territories, optimal number of addresses per territory, which addresses should belong to which territory, and the best use of drivers, vehicles, and territories.",
