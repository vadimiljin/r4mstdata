Unlike traditional geofencing that requires manual setup, this technology automatically generates geofences for each stop, making it ideal for businesses with changing routes like delivery or field service operations. This automation eliminates the need to manually draw geofence shapes while allowing for customizable parameters. When drivers enter customer locations, the system detects arrivals and departures, generating immutable timestamps that enhance tracking accuracy and operational insights. This technology works alongside manual status updates, where drivers mark destinations as 'Arrived' and 'Done', providing multiple verification points for customer service activities. Dynamic Geofencing helps identify patterns indicating recurring problems at stops, such as excessive wait times or customer connection issues, enabling schedule adjustments and improved communication.",
