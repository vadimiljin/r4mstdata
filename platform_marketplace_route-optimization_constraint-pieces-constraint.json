One of the many constraints you can use for your routes in our platform is maximum pieces per route. Route planning is complicated. There's more to it than just figuring out the best directions to give your drivers \u2013 you also need to account for traffic, construction, weather, customer availability, and many other factors. This task can take a long time when you try to do it by yourself. Depending on the number of field employees you have, it can take hours. And when you try to account for maximum pieces per route in addition to those other factors, it will take even longer. With Route4Me, you can account for maximum pieces per route with just the touch of a button. That gives you more time to focus on all of the other tasks you need to complete to run your business.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint","featureList":["Set maximum pieces per route constraint","Control stop distribution to field employees","One-touch constraint activation","Account for multiple routing factors"]},{"@type":"Action","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#action","name":"Try Route Capacity Constraints","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://route4me.com/contact"},"description":"Contact our team to learn how to implement maximum pieces per route constraints in your delivery operations","object":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#thing"}},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#capacity","name":"Capacity Management Features","value":"Maximum pieces per route, one-touch constraint activation"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#implementation","name":"Implementation Requirements","value":"Route4Me platform"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#benefits","name":"Business Benefits","value":"Reduced planning time, account for multiple routing factors"},{"@type":"ItemList","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#featurelist","name":"Maximum Pieces per Route Features","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Control stop distribution to field employees"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Set maximum pieces per route"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Account for traffic conditions"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Account for construction"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"name":"Account for weather"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":6,"name":"Account for customer availability"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":7,"name":"One-touch constraint activation"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":8,"name":"Save planning time"}],"itemListOrder":"Unordered"},{"@type":"CreativeWork","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#help","name":"Documentation","url":"https://support.route4me.com/","author":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"about":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#thing"}},{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/constraint-pieces-constraint/#primaryimage","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-core/img/platform/routing/route-planning-with-maximum-pieces-per-route.png","caption":"Set maximum pieces or skids settings per route","alternateName":"Set limits on how many pieces or skids are permitted in each route","width":742,"height":460},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
