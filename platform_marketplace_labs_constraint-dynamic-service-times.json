Instead of using simple time estimates for each stop, you can use measurements you know (like number of items being delivered) as a proxy for time. For example, in beer delivery, different activities take different amounts of time - parking takes 5 minutes, confirming with store manager takes 2 minutes, and getting kegs out takes varying times depending on their location in the truck. This makes operations more streamlined and efficient, helping you save time, improve customer satisfaction, and make more money.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-dynamic-service-times/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-dynamic-service-times/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-dynamic-service-times","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_service_management","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(commerce)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(production_processes)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management"],"subjectOf":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-dynamic-service-times/#webpage"}},{"@type":"Action","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-dynamic-service-times/#action","name":"Request
