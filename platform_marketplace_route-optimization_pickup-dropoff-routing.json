This optimization can be used for non-emergency medical transport dispatch, replenishment routing, food delivery, and much more. This solution is perfect for businesses that need to visit customer addresses in pairs, such as picking up people or packages from one location and dropping them off at another location in the most efficient and cost-effective sequence.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/pickup-dropoff-routing/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/pickup-dropoff-routing/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/pickup-dropoff-routing","alternateName":["Paired
