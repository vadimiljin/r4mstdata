Some customers want you to visit or service them at the rooftop location of their building, while others require you to stop at the curbside (e.g. waste management, equipment rental). The problem is that when you're optimizing routes and customer locations are very far back from the road, the number of long-driveways or alleys starts adding up... and results in unwanted or inaccurate hours and miles to. Route4Me can help eliminate these complex inconsistencies by routing to the curbside or to the rooftop, on a customer-by-customer address basis. Geofences are also linked to the curbside or rooftop based on your preference. This is particularly important if your billing or service levels for curbside versus in-building, white-glove service requires you to keep track of all these moving parts. Route4Me also allows your customers to track the incoming driver in real-time, so they'll never get caught off-guard by one of your team members arrival.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(commerce)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curbside_pickup"],"softwareRequirements":"requires active Route4Me subscription","additionalProperty":[{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/curbside-delivery/#delivery"},{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/curbside-delivery/#tracking"},{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/curbside-delivery/#service"}],"featureList":["Customer-specific routing to curbside or rooftop","Geofence linking to curbside or rooftop","Real-time driver tracking for customers","Service level differentiation","Billing tracking for service types"],"about":[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Last Mile Delivery","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Delivery Services","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(commerce)"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Curbside Pickup","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curbside_pickup"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Fleet Management","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Geofencing","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence"}],"isRelatedTo":{"@type":"SoftwareApplication","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/route-optimization-software/#softwareapplication","name":"Route4Me Route Optimization Software","operatingSystem":"Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS","applicationCategory":"BusinessApplication","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.6","ratingCount":"25736","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","description":"The weighted aggregate rating was calculated using ratings from multiple platforms (weighted by review count and platform credibility): Google Play (4.3, 14544 reviews, weight 0.7), Apple App Store (4.6, 10700 reviews, weight 1.5), Capterra (4.4, 390 reviews, weight 4.0) and G2 (4.6, 102 reviews, weight 5.0).
