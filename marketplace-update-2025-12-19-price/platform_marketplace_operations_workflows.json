Digitally capture the necessary information at every customer visit with Route4Me's Workflows. Meet your unique business needs and enhance the proof of delivery, visit, and service process. Customize tasks specifically for your business and tailor those tasks to each stop. Create Workflows with a set of optional and mandatory tasks techs and drivers are required to complete. Use the mobile app to prompt drivers through each step of the process before they can mark the stop as done. Use the Route4Me mobile app to ensure workers collect the right proof of delivery or service. A delivery driver may need to capture a signature and photo for proof of delivery, but the next stop requires ID verification with a signature. A service technician may need to take a picture of the faulty part before removing, capture a serial number, or get a video of the repaired equipment, but at the next stop may only need a photo and signature.","offers":{"@type":"Offer","name":"Workflows Monthly Subscription","description":"$10 per user per month for customized workflows that improve driver and technician productivity","availability":"https://schema.org/InStock","category":"Add-On Service","additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Billing Frequency","value":"Monthly"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Per-User Pricing","value":"Yes"}]},"additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Field Data Collection","value":"Signatures, photos, ID verification, notes, videos, serial numbers"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Workflow Customization","value":"Mandatory and optional tasks, stop-specific tasks"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Mobile Capabilities","value":"Mobile app integration, step-by-step process"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Business Process Integration","value":"Proof of delivery, proof of service"}],"featureList":["Create customized task sequences for drivers and technicians","Tailor specific tasks for each stop on a route","Capture digital signatures for proof of delivery or service","Document service with photos","Verify customer ID","Record equipment serial numbers","Configure mandatory and optional tasks","Prompt drivers through steps at each stop","Maintain complete fulfillment history","Improve point of service experience","Reduce support issues"],"about":[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Field Service Management","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_service_management"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Workflow","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Electronic signature","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Proof of delivery","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_delivery"},{"@type":"Thing","name":"Digital transformation","sameAs":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation"}],"isRelatedTo":{"@type":"SoftwareApplication","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/route-optimization-software/#softwareapplication","name":"Route4Me Route Optimization Software","operatingSystem":"Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS","applicationCategory":"BusinessApplication","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.6","ratingCount":"25736","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","description":"The weighted aggregate rating was calculated using ratings from multiple platforms (weighted by review count and platform credibility): Google Play (4.3, 14544 reviews, weight 0.7), Apple App Store (4.6, 10700 reviews, weight 1.5), Capterra (4.4, 390 reviews, weight 4.0) and G2 (4.6, 102 reviews, weight 5.0).
