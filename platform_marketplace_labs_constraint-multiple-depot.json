You just need to input depot locations, customer addresses, and driver information to get optimized routes in less than a minute. This saves time, reduces fuel consumption, and improves customer satisfaction. Our system offers three flexible options: routes with multiple depots without constraints, routes with predefined address distribution per depot, or routes with both predefined distribution and sequencing. This advanced constraint solution eliminates the hours of manual planning and the high risk of errors associated with complex multi-depot routing scenarios, making it ideal for businesses with distributed operations across multiple warehouses or distribution centers.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot","alternateName":["Multi-Depot Route Optimization","Advanced Depot Constraint System"],"sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem"],"subjectOf":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#webpage"}},{"@type":"Action","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#action","name":"Request Multiple Depot Implementation","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://route4me.com/contact"},"description":"Contact our route optimization team to discuss implementing multiple depot routing for your organization","object":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#thing"}},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#flexibility","name":"Routing Flexibility Options","value":"Free distribution model, predefined distribution model, predefined distribution and sequence model"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#requirements","name":"Required Information","value":"Depot locations, customer addresses, number of drivers"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#benefits","name":"Key Benefits","value":"Routes ready in under a minute, save time, save gas, keep customers happy"},{"@type":"ItemList","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#featurelist","name":"Multiple Depot Constraint Features","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Support for multiple depots in route planning"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Free address distribution across depots"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Predefined address distribution per depot"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Predefined distribution and sequence option"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"name":"Generate routes in under one minute"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":6,"name":"Account for traffic and construction"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":7,"name":"Handle customer availability windows"}],"itemListOrder":"Unordered"},{"@type":"CreativeWork","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#help","name":"Multiple Depot Constraint Documentation","url":"https://support.route4me.com/?s=route%20planning%20constraints","author":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation"},"about":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#thing"}},{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/labs/constraint-multiple-depot/#primaryimage","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-core/img/marketplace/constraint-multiple-depot.png","caption":"Multiple Depot Constraint for Optimized Route Planning","alternateName":"Advanced route optimization system for businesses with multiple distribution centers or warehouses","width":800,"height":398},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
