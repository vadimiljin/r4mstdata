Once you insert one or multiple breaks into a route, Route4Me will automatically choose the most optimal location and sequence position for each break stop, and recalculate the route's ETAs accordingly. To accommodate the particular requirements of your business or unique business model, Route4Me provides multiple break insertion options. For example, you can insert breaks after a specific amount of travel time, or after a certain time of being on duty to comply with government regulations. To make sure that your field employees don't get fatigued when working on-site, you can insert breaks after a certain amount of service time, or after they have serviced a specific number of route stops.","additionalType":"https://schema.org/softwareAddOn","image":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#primaryimage"},"potentialAction":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#action"},"url":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion","alternateName":["Automatic Break Scheduler"],"sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hours_of_service","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_management","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_planning_software"],"subjectOf":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#webpage"}},{"@type":"Action","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#action","name":"Request Driver Breaks Implementation","target":{"@type":"EntryPoint","urlTemplate":"https://route4me.com/contact"},"description":"Contact our team to discuss implementing the Driver Breaks Add-On for your organization","object":{"@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#thing"}},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#compliance","name":"Compliance Features","value":"Hours of service compliance, driver fatigue prevention, civil penalty prevention"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#breakoptions","name":"Break Insertion Options","value":"Travel time-based breaks, duty-time breaks, service-time breaks, stop-count breaks"},{"@type":"ItemList","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#featurelist","name":"Driver Breaks Add-On Features","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Insert operational breaks into pre-planned routes with the touch of a button"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Automatically choose the most optimal location for break stops"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Automatically determine sequence position for each break stop"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Recalculate route ETAs to account for breaks"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"name":"Insert breaks after specific amount of travel time"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":6,"name":"Insert breaks after certain time of being on duty"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":7,"name":"Insert breaks after certain amount of service time"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":8,"name":"Insert breaks after servicing specific number of route stops"}],"itemListOrder":"Unordered"},{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://route4me.com/platform/marketplace/route-optimization/driver-breaks-insertion/#primaryimage","url":"https://apps-static.route4me.com/resources/addons/website-core/img/platform/routing/route-planning-with-driver-breaks.png","caption":"Insert driver breaks into planned routes","alternateName":"Route planning with driver breaks","width":800,"height":446},{"@type":"Corporation","@id":"https://route4me.com/#corporation","name":"Route4Me","url":"https://route4me.com","brand":"Route4Me","logo":"https://apps-static.routeml.com/structured-data/route4me-logo.png","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-888-552-9045","contactType":"Sales","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"New Customers"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+1-855-768-8344","contactType":"Customer Support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":"en","description":"Existing Customers"}],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/Route4Me","https://twitter.com/route4me","https://www.linkedin.com/company/route4me","https://www.youtube.com/Route4Me","https://www.g2.com/products/route4me/reviews","https://www.capterra.com/p/149633/Route4Me/"],"foundingDate":"2009","legalName":"Route4Me, Inc.","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Khasis","sameAs":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankhasis/"},"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1010 N.
